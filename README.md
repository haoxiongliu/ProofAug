This repo implements the ProofAug method introduced in our work ["ProofAug: Efficient Neural Theorem Proving via Fine-grained Proof Structure Analysis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18310). 

We achieve a pass rate of 66.0% on miniF2F-test in 2100 attempts using Isabelle, setting a new state of the art. 

Also, the Lean version of ProofAug that can improve the performance of Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-1.5B by 6.1%.

See [isabelle_src](isabelle_src/) for the Isabelle implementation and [lean_src](lean_src/) for the Lean implementation.
